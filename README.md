dwolla-sample-rails-app
================

## What is this?

This barebones Rails app demonstrates usage of the [`dwolla-ruby`](https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-ruby) gem.  Currently, it implements OAuth and the Transactions.Send endpoint as an example of how an application would accept payments with Dwolla.  We intend to grow this into a full demo of all the Dwolla API's functionality.

## Installation

Just run `bundle install` to install dependencies.

## Giving it a spin

Launch the Rails server: 

```rails s``` 

Then visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## TODO

- Implement all endpoints
- Make it a little less hurtful to the eyes.
